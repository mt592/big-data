# Big Data Course

A compilation of work completed in the Big Data course I took during my master's program. 

### Projects completed:

* **acm_citation_analysis** (final project) - using the [weighted page rank algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), understand which papers in the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/digital-library) database get cited most frequently and are most 'important' in the network. Read more [here](acm_citation_analysis/final_report.pdf).
* **common_followers** - explore which social media users mutually follow one another. 
* **common_movies** - identify people with the highest overlap in common movie viewing.
* **wikipedia_and_higgs** - find [symmetric wikipedia URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)). Create in-degree distribution of the [higgs social media data set](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/higgs-twitter.html).
* **yelp_average_stars** - calculate the average stars per business on Yelp using MapReduce and Map-Combine-Reduce. 
* **yelp_restaurant_ml** - Use text mining techniques and machine learning to predict the star rating of restaurants on Yelp using the raw text reviews. 

#### Tech stack:

* Hadoop 
* Scala 
* Spark/PySpark
